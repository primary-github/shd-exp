This book is about the traditional Chinese religious text concerning Taoism. The Tao or the way, is a sort of ineffable life force present in everything. The author of the book Lao Tzu, true to the Daoist manner, is shrouded in mystery. No one is sure of whether the author was a real person or perhaps a group of authors. Many of the teachings contained therein are also concise and leave more to be desired for clarification. This is intentional.

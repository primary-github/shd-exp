# tanka
Page 19
- Contain two poetic images
- first is taken from nature
- second is a meditative complement to the nature image
- tanka is analogously described as the poet holding up two mirrors. One reflecting nature and one reflecting the first mirror including the poet.

# haikus 
Page 22
Since the 16th century there are about three conventions that have been universally accepted as to a haiku's form:
1. The haiku describes a single state or event
2. the time of the haiku is in the present tense
3. The haiku refers to images connected to one of the 4 seasons.

Haikus capture the "ahh-ness" Of a moment, page 24

There is an attempt to say something without saying it in haikus, page 24

Boshu, a famous haiku poet, suggests the author should become unconscious to the object they are perceiving. He says: "about the pine, learn from the pine; about the reed, learn from the reed.", page 24

Japanese have a cultural custom of providing with their last will, a *Jitsei* which is a farewell poem to life, page 27.

"Reality is far more complex than any logic and at the same time, far more simple", page 29

Had I not known / that I was dead / already /I would have mourned / my loss of life

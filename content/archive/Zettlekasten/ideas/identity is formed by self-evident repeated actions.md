# Note

The identity that we associate with is often formed by which repeatable actions we perceive ourselves as doing more often than not. This is why it is important to think of the [[aggregate of marginal gains, habits]] in the formation of a new habit. Often we will not see ourselves as a "gym-goer" for the first few weeks of attending the gym, and in those first few weeks, it'll be harder than ever to maintain the habit. However, once that threshold is reached where we can identify ourselves as a gym-goer, this is how a life-long habit is formed.[^1]

To take effective notes when reading, there needs to be an access of meta cognition. True understanding and [[memory encoding]] occurs when we attempt to rephrase an idea in our on words. This is because we are forced to deal with the underlying message of a text and we learn to actually understand it by finding ways to express the same thing in another form. For this reason, literature notes taken while reading texts that will go into this vault should, in the majority, be rephrases of the prominent ideas instead of mere quotations. Some quotations are of course necessary as it may be a particularly well captured idea from the author that is too good to change.

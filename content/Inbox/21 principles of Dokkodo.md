[[Miyamoto Musashi]] was a prominent Japanese ronin samurai and philosopher. Just prior to his death, he finished two books: The Book of 5 Rings and The Path of Aloneness (Dokkodo). The former was a book detailing his unique swordsmanship style and the latter contained 21 philosophies he had learned on life during his alone contemplations.

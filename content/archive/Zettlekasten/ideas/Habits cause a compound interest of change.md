# Note

Due to the principle of [[aggregate of marginal gains, habits]], habits may be said to operate in a compounding manner in that bad habits which reduce your progression towards a goal by 1% every day and repeating these errors multiple times a day without conscious thought, will undoubtedly compound toxic results. Conversely, if one were to be 1% more productive in their habits daily their lives would improve rapidly.[^1] This means its "*[[important to win the tiny battles]]*".[^2]

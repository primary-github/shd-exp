Digital gardens is a term that is becoming wildly popular in the productivity sphere. Digital gardens are a form of [[PKM]] which have been described as a cross over between a note book and a blog.[^1]

Digital gardens often follow the zettlekasten workflow but instead of permanent notes they have evergreen notes, instead of ideas they have seedlings and other natural analogies.

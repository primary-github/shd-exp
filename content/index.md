# What's Going on Here? ðŸŽˆ

The shared experience is a proof of concept contributed by two collaborators, Sam and Josh. 
There have been countless positive studies to the effect that [[collaborative learning]] can be a facilitator in increasing learning effectiveness. We are attempting to provide a demonstration on the benefits (or no doubt, drawbacks) in developing a collaborative learning environment with emphasis on [[zettlekasten]] methodologies and prove, undeniably, that [[Computers can extend cognition]] and [[collaborative learning]] can be exploited using these emergent progressive note taking systems.  

## Why publish this site

We subscribe to the principle of [[working with the garage door open]]. We intend that this website and a community will flourish from continuous improvements over time. This also provides a creative outlet to its collaborators. The ideal outcome of this vault will be that its collaborators develop:

- Better tools for thought
- Retrievable relevant knowledge
- Academic and creative writing skills

We intend that this project will expand to have many collaborators but in its early proof-of-concept days, we have restricted its collaboration to a small group.

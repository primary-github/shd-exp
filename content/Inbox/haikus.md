Haikus are a very simply ruled form of poetry which requires a three verse poem with a syllable maximum of 5, 7, and 5 syllabals respectively for each of the three verses per haiku. 

Haiku example:

All the world's a stage (5 syllabals)
Implying I have a part (7 syllabals)
But I have no script(5 syllabals)

You'll also notice a freedom of haikus is that they can contain no rhymes.

A good guide to haikus:

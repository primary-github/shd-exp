# Note

Habits are best changed when they are brought about by a change of identity. What is meant by this is the reaching of the stage where one might say "I'm not a smoker" instead of "I'm trying to quit smoking" when offered a cigarette or nicotine vape. This slight semantic difference is indicative of a greater perspective difference in that the latter response is by one who still associates themselves as a smoker.[^1]

James Clear advocates that this step, the shift in identity, is the most important and effective method of creating life-long beneficial habits.[^2]

This leads one to ask, how does one change their identity though?:
- [[take pride in processes or outcomes to change your identity]];
- [[identity is formed by self-evident repeated actions]];
- [[ask yourself who is the type of person who'd achieve my desired goals, habits]]

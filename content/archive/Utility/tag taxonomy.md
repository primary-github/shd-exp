# Why keep a tag taxonomy
The limitations of tags as described by crowd funded cognitive scientist, [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), is that they merely provide an unordered list of associated items. They do not provide the context of any associations meaning that one must still rely on their internal cognitive or memory retrieval abilities to gain an understanding on how, and more importantly, why any of the items have association with each other.

## Topic tags

Already created tags should be given preference over the creation of new ones. Tags which become congested with notes should be considered for turning into an index or concept note.

Topic tags are used for extra note discoverability. Topic tags may eventually evolve into concept notes or index notes once a critical mass of notes accumulate under a topic. Topic tags are 
- poetry - relating to notes about poetry. 
- productivity - notes which pertain to increasing ones productivity in various disciplines
	- note-taking - notes which describe methodologies or best practices on note taking
	- habits - notes on the formation of habits, the psychology of the formation and how to break bad habits.
- philosophy - notes relating to philosophy analysis or best practice.

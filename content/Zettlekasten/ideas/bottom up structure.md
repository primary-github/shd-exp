# Note

Bottom up structure is the idea that all components of a set of data begin at an equal level of hierarchy. Over time, by addition of more nodes of data, an apparent structure will emerge based on the contextual uses of that data. This provides several scopes of understanding components of information. It defeats the [[limitations of top down structures]] by providing multiple entry points to a set of information which increases the likelihood of unlikely connections being developed between associated ideas.

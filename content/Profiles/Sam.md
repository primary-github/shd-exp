Is the following proposition true:  [[the whole is more than the sum of its parts]]

Can emergent properties be reduced to their fundamental interactions? 

Can the behaviour of a system truly be understood solely through the interactions of its parts?

It may be the case that this is an issue regarding level of analysis. For example, If I were to attempt to understand how an organisation fundamentally operates by having an extended discussion with a low-level employee, I would only have insight into one, dimly lit corner of the larger organisational system. This holds true with understanding such things as aerodynamics. If I wanted to understand the behaviour of flight and only studied a bird's feather under a microscope, I would miss the broader mechanisms of flight.

The above issue is inherent when you have a system of sufficient complexity. Multiple levels of organisation interact to produce higher-order functionality. Therefore, the initial questions should be rephrased to more specifically address the following:

- What levels of organisation are relevant?
- Which components within these levels are of interest?
- What emergent behaviour are we seeking to understand?

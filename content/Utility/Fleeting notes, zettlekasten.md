Fleeting notes are considered to be notes that are frictionless to make. They do not require formatting or any further steps at the time of taking them besides the requirement that they contain enough context to be later understood. Fleeting notes can be taken anywhere that allows for words to be displayed but ideally, they should be taken and placed immediately in the inbox so that they are not lost in a miasma of notes and information in all the systems that we interact with on a daily basis.

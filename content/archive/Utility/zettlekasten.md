# Summary of Concept

Zettlekasten is the german word for "slipbox" and is a note-taking system.

# Relevant Ideas

Zettlekasten is the german word for "slipbox". It is a note taking methodology that was popularized by the social scientist [[Nicklas Luhmann]] which consisted of index card notes inside of a filing cabinet.[^1] This system denoted three types of notes:
- [[Fleeting notes, zettlekasten]] ^30c51c
- [[Literature notes, zettlekasten]]
- [[Permanent notes, zettlekasten]]

With the rise of the [[PKM]] and [[Second brain]] movements with influencers such as Sonke Ahrens, Tiago Forte and Nick Milo, Zettlekasten ideals have been being introduced to mainstream productivity enthusiasts. While many still prefer Luhmann's analog method, many have highlighted the limitations of it that may be broken with a digital Zettlekasten (with a few practicality tweaks).

The collaborators of Shared Experience recognise that a complete adherence to this system in digital form would be too rigid. The main inherit benefit of Zettlekasten is that it provides a [[bottom up structure]].

# Note

There are 4 "laws" or steps to behavioural change and they come by manipulating an already well-known understood system for the formation of habits.

Habits are formed by:[^1]
- A cue/reminder which triggers the thought process;
- A craving is then created to satisfy some desire;
- We then respond to that craving by completing some action; and
- Some reward associated with the pattern of behaviour occurs.

Behavioural change can be implemented by making good habits which hack the above habit system by making the object of a habit:[^2]
- more obvious (cue)
- more attractive (craving)
- more easy (response)
- more satisfying (reward)

The opposite for bad habits would be:[^3]
- make it invisible
- make it unattractive
- make it difficult
- make it unsatisfying.

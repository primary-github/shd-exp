A key truism in our current understanding of [[memory encoding]] is that the process works most effectively when abstract ideas can be linked to nodes of information pertaining to what you already know.[^1] This allows for better retrieval of information which is what transforms raw information into knowledge. The Shared Experience is an attempt at digitally making a seamless workflow for this process. We are distilling information into their core idea and then constantly coming back and adding new connections between other nodes in the information network.[^2]

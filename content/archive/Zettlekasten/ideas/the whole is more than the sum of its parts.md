**Strong Emergence:** An organism is composed of levels of organisation ranging from molecules and atoms to organs and organ systems. However, the overall behavior and properties of an organism are not merely the sum of its individual components. For example, while a human is comprised of these parts, it displays complex behaviors such as self-reflection that aren't characteristics of its singular components. Central to the concept of strong emergence is the idea that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. This notion of strong emergence is distinct from **weak emergence**, wherein [emergent properties can be explained by the interactions of a system's components] and can thus be causally reduced.

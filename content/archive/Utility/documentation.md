> [!example]- Note's purpose
> Index notes can be seen as the "furthest zoomed out" notes of the vault. They represent a map of concepts and ideas or are strictly for utility. Index notes may also contain some meta information about a certain topic but only rudimentary as anything deeper should be captured in a concept or idea note

# Taxonomy and structure notes
- We will aim to follow an augmented [[zettlekasten]] workflow for our notes.
- Since tags are "fuzzy",[^1] we will maintain a [[tag taxonomy]] to continue to understand the significance of a given tag. It is through a tagging system that we may also delineate from [[types of notes]]. 
- We will maintain documentation as to the [[folder structure]] of our vault because folders face the same "fuzzy" association limitations that tags do. 

# principles guiding our note taking
- [[note taking must be personal]]
- [[connecting new ideas to what you already know strengthens your memory of new ideas]]. This will be implemented by integrating regular revisiting of ideas to form new connections with other ideas.

- [[emergent structure is good note taking practice]]
- No [[collectors fallacy]] and note hoarding (i.e not taking notes just for its own sake)
- To that end, we recognise that [[Note taking must be used for a purpose]]
- [[working with the garage door open]]
- [[An inbox is only effective if its being emptied]], ideally more than entries are being added.

# Note taking workflow

Our workflow will consist of an emergent [[bottom up structure]] that 
- rephrase and take notes from literature that interests us, creating [[literature notes should be rephrasing]];
- decontextualize and distill [[atomic idea]] from our literature notes; and
- spend time perusing this vault to find potential connections of new ideas to what we already know or has already been added. This will allow ideas to grow and [[form connections between ideas]]

In doing so, we will attempt a [[daily writing practice]] and [[study]] various topics together. These topics will be distilled into their [[atomic idea]].

[^1]: Tags don't often provide any valuable structure in that associations between similarly tagged items do not indicate their association and merely group them into unordered lists.
